# what-vision-os-can-do

This project serves as a showcase for the remarkable ideas behind visionOS. It can be likened to a gallery that demonstrates the vast range of capabilities offered by visionOS.

Besides, this is also the demo project of the **visionOS Bootstrap**.

## So, What is visionOS Bootstrap?

Bootstrap, in computer terminology refers to a series of startup programs or switch circuits that start a computer. 

In web development, there is also a well-known front-end framework called Bootstrap, which helps developers quickly build a website through a series of basic styles and layouts.
The **visionOS Bootstrap** series is to do such a thing: we use a large number of basic API usage examples and display what amazing effects can be made, so that you can quickly get started and understand visionOS and the development skills behind it.
After all, most people's basic understanding of new things starts with specific examples.
Currently this series is updated at least once a week. If you are interested in this series, you can checkout [How to Contribute](#How to Contribute) below.
